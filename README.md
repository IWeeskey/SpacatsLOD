Spacats LOD.
Spacats LOD is a custom Level of Detail system designed to determine LOD levels based on the distance to a specified Transform. Unlike Unity‚Äôs built-in LODGroup, it gives you direct access to the current LOD index, optimized with Jobs + Burst, and supports both static and dynamic use cases.

‚ú® FEATURES
* Works in the Editor ‚Äì no need to hit Play just to test setups.
* Mobile-ready ‚Äì tested and running smoothly on mobile devices.
* Jobified & Bursted ‚Äì all LOD checks are done using Unity Jobs and Burst for high performance.
* Sync or Async ‚Äì choose between synchronous updates or async jobs depending on your use case.
* Custom update interval ‚Äì configure check frequency in milliseconds (every frame, or every few seconds).
* Two controller modules:
* DynamicLOD ‚Äì for moving transforms (NPCs, birds, vehicles, etc.). Example scene: DynamicLOD.
* StaticLOD ‚Äì for static props like trees, rocks, or buildings. Slightly faster since transform data doesn‚Äôt need to be rebuilt every check. Example scene: StaticLOD.
* LOD change events ‚Äì easily subscribe to LOD index changes on any LOD unit.
* Cuboid distance checks for static objects ‚Äì instead of checking distance only to object center, you can use a custom cuboid. Perfect for elongated meshes (e.g. fences, bridges). Example scene: StaticLOD Cuboid.
* Smooth transitions ‚Äì sample scenes show how to fade objects in/out using the lightweight Spacats.MonoTween. Examples: DynamicLOD Smooth and StaticLOD Smooth.

‚ùì WHY SPACATS LOD?
Unity‚Äôs built-in LOD system is great, but it doesn‚Äôt expose the current LOD level. Workarounds usually mean brute-forcing all objects every frame, checking LODGroups manually ‚Äì which is heavy on the main thread.
Spacats LOD solves this by handling LOD logic entirely in Jobs, only passing changed results back to the main thread.

‚öôÔ∏è HOW IT WORKS
1) Job step ‚Äì all LOD units are processed in a Burst job, with results stored as changed indices.
2) Main thread step ‚Äì the main thread only applies changes to affected GameObjects.

üìä PERFORMANCE
Test Environment (PC):
* Laptop: MSI GP76 Leopard, Windows 10
* Unity version: 2022.3.39f (final build, not editor)
	** Note: Unity 2023 editor introduces noticeable overhead, but this issue is not present in 2022.3.39f.
* CPU: Intel i7-11800H (11th Gen, 2.3 GHz)
* Turbo Boost disabled via BIOS
* Test scale: 250,000 objects

Dynamic Case (all 250k objects constantly moving)
* Job execution: 1.5 ms ‚Äì 1.9 ms (can be fully offloaded asynchronously)
* ~800 LOD changes: +1 ms on main thread (typical for fast but smooth player movement)
* ~4,000 LOD changes: +3‚Äì4 ms on main thread (e.g. when teleporting to a new area)
	**	This overhead cannot be reduced further, since it must be executed in Unity‚Äôs main thread.
	
Static Case (objects do not move)
* Job execution: 1.0 ms ‚Äì 1.1 ms (asynchronous)
* 4,000 LOD changes: +3‚Äì4 ms on the main thread. This cost is identical to the dynamic case and independent of total object count.

Test Environment (Mobile):
* Device: Tecno Spark 8C (Android)
* Test scale: 10,000 objects

Dynamic Case
* Job execution: 0.8 ms ‚Äì 1.2 ms
* ~3,000 LOD changes: +7‚Äì9 ms on main thread

Static Case
* Job execution: 0.4 ms ‚Äì 1.1 ms
* ~3,000 LOD changes: +7‚Äì9 ms on main thread

Observations & Conclusions:
On PC, the system handles 250k objects with stable timings; only heavy teleportation events introduce 3‚Äì4 ms spikes in the main thread.
On mobile, even with 10k objects, the system easily fits within the 17 ms frame budget (60 FPS).
Scaling beyond this on mobile would require a different rendering strategy (e.g. chunk-based batching) rather than brute-force LOD updates.
You can also download Android build and try it out yourself (can be found in releases).
